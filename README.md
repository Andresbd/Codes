# Codes
These are a selected group of class works and projects developed in the data structure course. They are all developed in Java, and I have full authority of them.

<h3>AVL</h3> It's a balanced binary search three that will autobalance every time the user adds or subtract nodes from it, the tree will auto balance.

<h3>Generics</h3> Generics help you pass a class as an argument, yhis implementation in java will summ pairs sent as parameters.

<h3>RSA</h3> RSA is an algorith mi cryptography that we developed in Algorithm Analysis class, it will allow you encrypt text with a strong level of security with my implementation of RSA algorithm.

<h3>RTrees</h3> This implementation of Rtrees uses ACM library to show a visual representation of the algorithm.

<h3>Strongly Connected</h3> This is a implementation of strongly connected graphs in python.
